# Mini React Library

_(This is a mini version of React Library with the purpose of researching deeper into React features, principles, and methodologies that the React Core team is using)_

### Features (function component only)

- Base features: React Node (aka virtual dom), Reconciler and Work Loop.
- Hooks: useState, useRef, useCallback, useMemo and useEffect.
- Component types: Fragment, JSX HTML (div, span, p, ...), function component.

### Guidance

- Run `yarn` to install all npm packages/dependencies
- Run `yarn dev` to start the example app (placed in` /src`)
- To open react execution flow diagram: download the file first, then launch the file with this app: [Diagram Tool](https://app.diagrams.net/)

### Other features (can be updated in the near future)

- Base features: Scheduler
- Hooks: useContext, useTransition, useDeferredValue, useSyncExternalStore, use.
- Component types: createPortal, Context(Provider/Consumer), Suspense, lazy component.

### Disclamer

- The features in this project are not tested so they cannot be used in production or any integrations with other react tool/libraries (for eg: redux, material UI)
- The principles, methodologies the author used here did not resemble exactly as the React Core team, for more information refer to [original source](https://github.com/facebook/react) or this [self-made diagram](https://github.com/minhhieu1612/mini-react-library/blob/main/react-execution-flow.drawio)(included in this project).
